This is a container for the Dronalize project. It contains all the necessary dependencies to run the project.
To run the project, you can use the following command:
```
apptainer run dronalize.sif <command> <args>
```
where `<command>` is the command you want to run and `<args>` are the arguments for the command.

For example, to run the train script, you can use the following command:
```
apptainer run dronalize.sif python train.py
```

To enable GPU support, you can use the following command:
```
apptainer run --nv dronalize.sif python train.py
```
